The index is built by a PHP script using a\r\nsimilar yet much more simplified and dump approach than the popular search enging [Lucene].\r\n\r\n[github pages]: https://pages.github.com/\r\n[Lucene]: http://lucene.apache.org/\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPHP 5.4 or higher is required to run the index generator.\r\n\r\nInstallation is recommended to be done via [composer][] by adding the following to the `require` section in your `composer.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"cebe/js-search\": \"*\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `composer update` afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTODO.\r\n\r\nSee [example.html](example.html) for an implementation.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
